Ct. 2002","court":"California Superior Court","description":"Popov sued Hayashi for conversion, believing that once it had touched his glove the baseball became his and although Hayashi came about it legally, he still had the duty to return it to its rightful owner.\r\n\r\nBefore the baseball was hit, it was considered property of MLB and after it was hit was considered intentionally abandoned property. Under this theory, whoever comes into possession of it first is the rightful owner.\r\n\r\nHowever, in all legal sense, Hayashi had come by the ball lawfully as well. In fact, if Popov had dropped the ball without having been attacked by the group of wrongdoers, it would have still been considered abandoned property that would be acquired by whomever successfully grasped it first.\r\n\r\nThe court considered that legal possession in this instance requires successfully attaining it and the intent to possess. Popov did both of these and so upon his losing it, it was considered his property. However, simultaneously, the court considered that his loss of it cancelled his possession of it and thus Hayashi was in legal possession. But simply giving Hayashi the rights to it would be unfair as well, as Popov would likely have certainly been in possession of it if not attacked by the wrongdoers.\r\n\r\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popov_v._Hayashi)\r\n\t\t\t","keywords":"possession, conversion, baseball","language":"English","majority":"","minority":"","title":"Popov v Hayashi","year":"2002"},"issues":{"i1":{"meta":{},"positions":["possession","no-possession"],"standard":"PE"}},"statements":{"dm-opportunistic":{"meta":null,"text":"dm-opportunistic","label":"in"},"dr-innocent":{"meta":null,"text":"dr-innocent","label":"in"},"hot-pursuit":{"meta":null,"text":"hot-pursuit","label":"in"},"informal-excluse-right":{"meta":null,"text":"informal-excluse-right","label":"in"},"market-value":{"meta":null,"text":"market-value","label":"in"},"no-possession":{"meta":null,"text":"no-possession","label":"in"},"other-owner":{"meta":null,"text":"other-owner","label":"in"},"pm-opportunistic":{"meta":null,"text":"pm-opportunistic","label":"in"},"possession":{"meta":null,"text":"possession","label":"out"},"resident":{"meta":null,"text":"resident","label":"in"},"violently-illegal":{"meta":null,"text":"violently-illegal","label":"in"}},"arguments":{"a0":{"meta":{},"scheme":"cumulative","parameters":[],"premises":["other-owner","market-value","informal-excluse-right","dm-opportunistic","pm-opportunistic","dr-innocent","hot-pursuit","violently-illegal","resident"],"conclusion":"possession","undercutter":"","weight":0},"a1":{"meta":{},"scheme":"cumulative","parameters":[],"premises":["other-owner","market-value","informal-excluse-right","dm-opportunistic","pm-opportunistic","dr-innocent","hot-pursuit","violently-illegal","resident"],"conclusion":"no-possession","undercutter":"","weight":0}},"references":{},"assumptions":["dm-opportunistic","violently-illegal","pm-opportunistic","resident","dr-innocent","other-owner","market-value","hot-pursuit","informal-excluse-right"],"labels":null}
